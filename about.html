              <p> 
                As a child, sports were my greatest passion. I particularly loved dancing and playing basketball.<br /> As I grew older and entered high school, I participated in the global organization FIRST and joined <br />the robotics team in Emek Hafar. In robotics, there was a global task that all teams around the world <br />had to complete, and each task was related to building a robot that performs a specific function. <br />The national team that wins the competition in Israel advances to the World Championship in the United States.

              <h1>After graduation from high school</h1>
              <p>
                After the robotics period and high school, I enlisted in the military and served in the Menashe<br /> Regional Division as a Operations icon. The role was crucial as it involved operational tasks aimed<br /> at maintaining security in the region. I went home once every two weeks, But it was comforting to <br />be  with all the friends together.

                After the military, I decided to study Industrial Engineering and  Management <br />to gain a higher education and, consequently, secure jobs I aspire to in the future.I completed a preparatory <br />program and then advanced to a bachelor's degree. Currently, I am in my third year of studies.
